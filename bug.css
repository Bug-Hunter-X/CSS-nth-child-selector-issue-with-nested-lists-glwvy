The following CSS code snippet attempts to style a list with alternating background colors. However, it might not work as expected in certain scenarios, particularly when dealing with deeply nested lists or lists with different structures.  The problem stems from the use of `:nth-child(odd)` and `:nth-child(even)`. These selectors only consider the direct children of the parent element. If the list has nested `<ul>` or `<ol>` elements, these nested list items will inherit the styling from their parent, ignoring the parent list's alternating background style. 

```css
ul {
  list-style-type: none;
  padding: 0;
}

li:nth-child(odd) {
  background-color: #f0f0f0;
}

li:nth-child(even) {
  background-color: #ffffff;
}
