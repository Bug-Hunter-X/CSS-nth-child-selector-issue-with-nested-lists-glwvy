Several solutions exist to address this issue. One effective approach is to use a counter. Here's how you can implement it:

```css
ul {
  list-style: none;
  padding: 0;
}

li {
  counter-increment: list-item;
}

li::before {
  content: counter(list-item) ". ";
}

li:nth-child(odd) {
  background-color: #f0f0f0;
}

li:nth-child(even) {
  background-color: #ffffff;
}
```

Another solution involves a more complex selector that accounts for nested lists and uses the `:nth-of-type` selector along with multiple `ul li` declarations. However, this method can become cumbersome with very deeply nested lists.  A counter-based approach is generally more maintainable and efficient in such scenarios.
